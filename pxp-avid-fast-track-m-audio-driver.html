Hello, I'm currently working on a video, one bit of footage that's about 2 hours long, 1080p 60fps, and two audio tracks of the same length.

Now my project is constantly getting these video glitches, like the footage is corrupt or something. So I checked the original footage, everything is fine. My first thought was maybe the hard drive

I have some hardware synths and I'm in need of an audio interface since my Avid Fast Track Duo is busted (crackling and distortion regardless of driver or audio settings).

I know most of us probably just power our whole system down when the computer's off, but I found leaving power to the computer stopped the bluescreen issues. You can also tell Windows to cut power to the USB ports on shutdown, which allows the interface to shut down without Windows forgetting that it exists - that means no unplug/re-plug every time you restart, potentially causing ANOTHER bluescr.
